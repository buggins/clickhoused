Fiber-mode I/O backend: vibe-core sockets, for code running in vibe.d tasks.

If a task is interrupted (`Task.interrupt`) while waiting for the server, the
`InterruptException` propagates unchanged and the connection is closed, because
the response was cut off.

Compiled only when vibe-core is in the application's dependency graph
(`version (Have_vibe_core)`, defined by dub). Blocking calls suspend the
calling task instead of the thread, so other tasks keep running.

A connection opened in fiber mode belongs to the thread (event loop) that
opened it. Any task on that thread may use it, one at a time; using it from
another thread throws `ClientException`.
